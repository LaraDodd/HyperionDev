# HyperionDev
This repo contains all code relating to the HyperionDev Software Engineering bootcamp.
This has given me a cornerstone understanding of: python programming, SQL, HTML, NLP and database manipulating. 
The projects in this course start from basic understanding of code and end in complex capstone project encompassing a range of different coding technologies.
